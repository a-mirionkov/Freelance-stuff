1. The entire amount will be refunded if I canâ€™t manage schedules after accepting a project.
2. I accept payment by milestones, there will be no refund for milestones completed (as agreed by the client).
3. If I can not finish the project within deadline, the client can ask for refund of the current milestone and they can end the contract.
